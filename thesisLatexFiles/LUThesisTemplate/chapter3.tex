\section{Models}

This thesis covers the Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment models, developed exhaustively in the literature.

\subsection{Indices and Sets}

\begin{tabular}{ll}

$g \in \mc{G} $& Set of generators\\
$b \in \mc{B} $& Set of buses\\
$g \in \mc{G}^{NR} $& Subset of non-renewable generators\\
$g \in \mc{G}^{R} $& Subset of renewable generators \\
$gt \in \mc{GT} $& Set of generator types \\
$u \in \mc{U} $& Set of unit groups \\
$l \in \mc{L} $& Set of transmission lines \\
$rr \in \mc{RR} $& Set of reserve requirements \\
$rp \in \mc{RP} $& Set of reserve products \\
$t \in \mc{T} $& Set of time periods \\

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{ll}

$L_{bt} $& Load at bus $b$ in time $t$ \\
$C_{g} $& Generation cost for generator g (\$ / MW) $t$ \\
$S_{g} $& Start-up cost for generator g \\
$R^{up}_{g} $& Ramp up limit for generator g \\
$R^{down}_{g} $& Ramp down limit for generator g \\
$G^{max}_{g} $& Maximum generation capacity for generator g \\
$G^{min}_{g} $& Minimum generation capacity for generator g \\
$T^{max}_{g} $& Maximum transmission of transmission line l \\
$P^{ren}_{g,t} $& Power generation of renewable generator g in time t\\

\end{tabular}


Note 1: The generation of renewable resources are not in the decision variables. The developed models only decides the generation for non-renewable resources. Therefore the generation is considered a deterministic parameter, not a variable in the model.

\subsection{Variables}

\begin{tabular}{ll}

$P^{ren}_{g,t} $& Power generation of non-renewable generator g in time t (MW)\\
$T_{i,j,t} $& Power transmitted from bus i to bus j in time t (MW)\\
$T^{loss}_{i,j,t} $& Power loss in transmission from bus i to bus j in time t (MW)\\
$S_{g,t} $& On/off status of generator g at time n\\
$S^{on}_{g,t} $& Start-up status of generator g at time n\\
$S^{off}_{g,t} $& Shut-down status of generator g at time n\\

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Economic Dispatch Models}

The economic dispatch model satisfies the load and transmission requirements at a minimum cost, following operational requirements such as generation, transmission and ramp limits. In this model, we assume that the commitment decisions has been already made.
