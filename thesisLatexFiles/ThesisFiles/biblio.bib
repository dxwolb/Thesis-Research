	abstract={Transmission switching (TS) is introduced in security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) for alleviating transmission violations and reducing operating costs. The SCUC problem is decomposed into the unit commitment (UC) master problem and the TS subproblem. The UC master problem finds the optimal hourly schedule of generating units. The TS subproblem uses this solution for transmission switching to find the optimal dispatch of units when considering network constraints. The TS subproblem also examines contingencies and identifies required changes to the UC master problem solution when contingencies cannot be mitigated in the TS subproblem. To propose a practical TS model, the standing phase angle difference limit is considered and relevant constraints are added to the TS subproblem. The case studies exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract={Unit commitment, one of the most critical tasks in electric power system operations, faces new challenges as the supply and demand uncertainty increases dramatically due to the integration of variable generation resources such as wind power and price responsive demand. To meet these challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model for the security constrained unit commitment problem in the presence of nodal net injection uncertainty. Compared to the conventional stochastic programming approach, the proposed model is more practical in that it only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than a hard-to-obtain probability distribution on the uncertain data. The unit commitment solutions of the proposed model are robust against all possible realizations of the modeled uncertainty. We develop a practical solution methodology based on a combination of Benders decomposition type algorithm and the outer approximation technique. We present an extensive numerical study on the real-world large scale power system operated by the ISO New England. Computational results demonstrate the economic and operational advantages of our model over the traditional reserve adjustment approach.},

	volume={113},
	pages={152-158},
	abstract={Abstract The objective of this work is to determine the impact of sub-hourly modelling of a power system with significant amounts of wind generation. This paper presents the modelling of the Irish power system for a one year period at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min resolution simulations using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model assuming perfect foresight. The work examines how much operational costs increase with more accurate resolution. Results show that increased temporal resolution captures more variability in system load and renewable generation, and is necessary to capture the inflexibilities of thermal units that lead to more realistic estimations in total generation costs. Significant cycling and ramping of units is also captured in higher resolution modelling that hourly resolution modelling is unable to capture.},

Our model is a mixed-integer linear program because it employs binary variables to represent the state of the equipment and linear relationships to describe the physical system. We find that on the standard 118-bus IEEE test case a savings of 25% in system dispatch cost can be achieved.},

	note={ID: 1},
	abstract={In response to the challenges brought on by the energy conservation based generation dispatch (ECGD) in China, a dynamic economic dispatch model that considers transmission losses (DED-TL) and a new solution framework are proposed to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of generation scheduling. Transmission losses are presented explicitly in the model so that the total energy consumption, consisting of both the generators' operation costs and also the transmission losses, can be well considered. The model is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem that can be solved by commercial solvers. A penalty-based algorithm is proposed to address the virtual transmission loss problem brought on by negative nodal marginal costs. Three cases-a 6-bus system, the IEEE 30-bus system, and a 2746-bus system based on the electric energy system of Poland-are employed in numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the better scheduling results in higher accuracy, and that good computational efficiency can be acquired via the proposed method.},

It utilizes chaotic variables to search the global optimal solution. It can gradually reduce the search space of optimized variables in order to improve the precision of solution. In addition, it can accelerate the convergence with the descending information of the object. Several numerical examples are tested with the proposed method. The simulation results show that the method being put forward is high effective and high precision and easy to use.}
