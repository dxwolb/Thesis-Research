	abstract={Unit commitment, one of the most critical tasks in electric power system operations, faces new challenges as the supply and demand uncertainty increases dramatically due to the integration of variable generation resources such as wind power and price responsive demand. To meet these challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model for the security constrained unit commitment problem in the presence of nodal net injection uncertainty. Compared to the conventional stochastic programming approach, the proposed model is more practical in that it only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than a hard-to-obtain probability distribution on the uncertain data. The unit commitment solutions of the proposed model are robust against all possible realizations of the modeled uncertainty. We develop a practical solution methodology based on a combination of Benders decomposition type algorithm and the outer approximation technique. We present an extensive numerical study on the real-world large scale power system operated by the ISO New England. Computational results demonstrate the economic and operational advantages of our model over the traditional reserve adjustment approach.},

	abstract={In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal generation dispatch and transmission topology to meet a specific inflexible load as a mixed integer program. Our model is a mixed-integer linear program because it employs binary variables to represent the state of the equipment and linear relationships to describe the physical system. We find that on the standard 118-bus IEEE test case a savings of 25% in system dispatch cost can be achieved.},

	note={ID: 1},
	abstract={In response to the challenges brought on by the energy conservation based generation dispatch (ECGD) in China, a dynamic economic dispatch model that considers transmission losses (DED-TL) and a new solution framework are proposed to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of generation scheduling. Transmission losses are presented explicitly in the model so that the total energy consumption, consisting of both the generators' operation costs and also the transmission losses, can be well considered. The model is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem that can be solved by commercial solvers. A penalty-based algorithm is proposed to address the virtual transmission loss problem brought on by negative nodal marginal costs. Three cases-a 6-bus system, the IEEE 30-bus system, and a 2746-bus system based on the electric energy system of Poland-are employed in numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the better scheduling results in higher accuracy, and that good computational efficiency can be acquired via the proposed method.},

	abstract={By means of the ergodicity, regularity and intrinsic stochastic property of chaos, one improved chaotic optimization algorithm is introduced to solve an economic dispatch problem for power plant and the optimal power flow problem for power system. It utilizes chaotic variables to search the global optimal solution. It can gradually reduce the search space of optimized variables in order to improve the precision of solution. In addition, it can accelerate the convergence with the descending information of the object. Several numerical examples are tested with the proposed method. The simulation results show that the method being put forward is high effective and high precision and easy to use.}
